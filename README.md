# yyunis.github.io

Hey! Welcome to my personal portfolio. This website was created with purely HTML and CSS, the barebones to create a website. Through this introductory project, I gained (the most) basic knowledge of web development and have applied these skills to other projects like a Strava-based web app called stwrapped.com. Feel free to look around at my portfolio found at yyunis.github.io.
