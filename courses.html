		18-202: mathematical foundations of electrical engineering
		<div class="class-notes">
			‣ math core course! i enjoyed the professors and consistency of this course<br>
			‣ fun to learn about matrices for the first time besides small portion in highschool
		</div>
	</div>
	<div class="class-title">
		⊠ 18-290: signals and systems
		<div class="class-notes">
			‣ despite being a core course, i really didn't enjoy this course. it was really theoretical and definitely confusing<br>
			‣ lectures were longer than usual and harder to pay attention in, very math heavy!
		</div>
	</div>
	<div class="class-title">
		✯ 18-240: structure and design of digital systems
		<div class="class-notes">
			‣ LOVE LOVE LOVE this course! the professors are both passionate about it and create a fun learning environment <br>
			‣ labs were stressful but very rewarding and fun to do, not super nit-picky like circuits but more hands-on than software classes <br>
			‣ hardware is definitely a different type of programming so it's hard to get used to, but i surprisingly really enjoyed this course. just make sure to stay on top of homework!
		</div>
	</div>
	<div class="class-title">
		69-151: intro to yoga
		<div class="class-notes">
			‣ fun and relaxing PE course <br>
			‣ sometimes stressful to go to when i had a lot of homework but teacher is very understanding and you're allowed to do work during the class (if you must)
		</div>
	</div>
	<div class="workload">
		workload:
		<div class="class-notes">
			‣ i took 3 main courses (besides the mini yoga class) and all 3 were core technical classes.
			i'm not sure i would do something like this again but it felt good to get my core + required classes over with after this semester.
			made good ece friends!

		</div>
	</div>
	<div class="class-title">
		⊠ 18-213: intro to computer systems
		<div class="class-notes">
			‣ this class is notoriously hard at cmu + for good reason~ the assignments in hindsight are not too difficult if you start the work early.<br>
			‣ important class for other higher level courses, so it's a good class to have a firm foundation on
		</div>
	</div>
	<div class="class-title">
		18-220: electronic devices and analog circuits
		<div class="class-notes">
			‣ in my opinion, the easiest ece core class <br>
			‣ labs were time consuming and the class got confusing towards the end, but fun when circuit worked <br>
		</div>

		✯ 85-241: social psychology

		spring 2022
		<div class="class-title">
			✯ 76-101: interpretation and argument
			<div class="class-notes">
				‣ mandatory first year writing, but surprisingly one of my favorite courses<br>
				‣ subject: becoming and unbecoming ourselves on social media, professor pal made this entire course worth it <br>
				‣ learned how to read/write research proposal essays, for final paper i did a cool research project on BeReal, a social media app
			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="class-title">
			⊠ 73-102: microeconomics
			<div class="class-notes">
				‣ i don’t think my brain is wired for microeconomics, i didn’t enjoy this class but the teaching was okay and assignments/exams were medium difficulty
			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="class-title">
			15-122: principles of imperative computation
			<div class="class-notes">
				‣ not as time consuming as 15-112 but not as much fun <br>
				‣ learning C syntax took a long time to get used to, especially only having python background <br>
				‣ overall, i recommend this class but not an essential course
			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="class-title">
			18-100: introduction to ece
			<div class="class-notes">
				‣ wide range of ece coverage but doesn’t go too in-depth with material <br>
				‣ some difficulty understanding the materials through lecture slides but the additional notes really helped <br>
				‣ labs took a really long time for me because of issues with macbook and scopy which was pretty frustrating but learned a lot overall, especially equipment <br>
				‣ enjoyed working with tools and circuits but the toolbox was heavy
			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="class-title">
			98-177: stuco—personal web development
			<div class="class-notes">
				‣ not that much of a time commitment but learned a lot of basic HTML and CSS <br>
				‣ i think i could’ve learned a lot more if i put in the time/effort but wasn’t one of my main focuses this semester <br>
				‣ i don’t think this course is totally necessary to learn web development and a lot of my learning came from the internet itself but good introduction course and teaching was good
			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="workload">
			workload:
			<div class="class-notes">
				‣ not as intense as fall 2021 but a lot of my time outside of academics 
				was used for my part time job and other activities like church. this semester could’ve been more 
				productive but i spent a lot of time playing and talking with friends. 
				i definitely prioritized making good memories with people over academics, which i think was a good choice.
			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="workload">
			notes:
			<div class="class-notes">
				‣ taking two gen eds and two core classes seem like a good balance for scheduling

<!-- FALL 2021 -->
	<div class="semester-title">
		fall 2021
		<div class="class-title">
			33-141: physics 1 for engineering
			<div class="class-notes">
				‣ CIT gen ed, i loved having anderson <br>
				‣ homework didn’t take that long and exams weren’t too difficult but having learned 
				physics 1 in high school definitely helped, although i didn’t understand much when i first 
				took it in high school
			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="class-title">
			⊠ 21-127: concepts of mathematics
			<div class="class-notes">
				‣ first time learning discrete mathematics, this class was very difficult especially because
				it wasn’t my first priority <br>
				‣ take with clive!! he is a genius and made the class very fun <br>
				‣ bigg time commitment and had trouble doing problem sets but exams weren’t the worst 
				thing in the world  
			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="class-title">
			27-100: introduction to material science engineering
			<div class="class-notes">
				‣ not a super hard class academically but i hated this class lol <br>
				‣ the class lectures and subjects were really boring and didn’t seem applicable to me, but 
				the labs were fun and more hands on <br>
				‣ i wouldn’t recommend this class unless you were a mat sci major because it was a 
				decent amount of work and there are more interesting intro engineering classes
			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="class-title">
			✯ 15-112: fundamentals of programming and cs
			<div class="class-notes">
				‣ first time learning cs but i thoroughly enjoyed the class and would recommend it to everyone <br>
				‣ MAJOR time commitment and definitely hard to get used to but worth the effort and help is extremely accessible <br>
				‣ working on homework and term project was really rewarding <br>
				‣ great introduction to cs because of immediate problem solving for homework
			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="workload">
			workload:
			<div class="class-notes">
				‣ jumping into two really time intensive courses as a freshman was definitely tough but i 
				wouldn’t have changed my schedule due to the importance of these classes as core 
				classes and as prerequisites. felt accomplished and rewarded at the end of the 
				semester but definitely ran into some difficult times during the semester.
			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="workload">
			notes:
			<div class="class-notes">
				‣ 1000% recommend taking 15-112 over 15-110 if possible/if time isn’t the biggest factor. 
				i had trouble finding community my first semester which also may have affected this 
				semester and my attitude towards it but academically, while tough, was a good way to 
				start my CMU education.
